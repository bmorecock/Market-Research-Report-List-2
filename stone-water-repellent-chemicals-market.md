<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Stone Water Repellent Chemicals Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water Based</li><li>Solvent Based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Stone water repellent chemicals are available in two main types: water-based and solvent-based. Water-based repellents use water as a carrier, making them eco-friendly and easier to use. They are ideal for use on porous surfaces like natural stone. Solvent-based repellents, on the other hand, use organic solvents as carriers, making them more durable and effective on non-porous surfaces. Both types of repellents provide protection against water damage and extend the lifespan of stone surfaces.</p></p>
