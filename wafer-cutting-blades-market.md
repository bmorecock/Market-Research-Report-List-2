<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wafer Cutting Blades Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hub Dicing Blades</li><li>Hubless Dicing Blades</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wafer cutting blades are used in the semiconductor industry for dicing silicon wafers into individual chips. There are two main types of wafer cutting blades: hub dicing blades and hubless dicing blades. Hub dicing blades have a center hub that connects the blades together, providing stability and support during the cutting process. Hubless dicing blades do not have a center hub, allowing for more flexibility and precision in cutting. Both types of blades are essential for the efficient and accurate production of semiconductor chips.</p></p>
