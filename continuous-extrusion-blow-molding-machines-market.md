<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Continuous Extrusion Blow Molding Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Shuttle Machines</li><li>Rotary Wheel Machines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Continuous Extrusion Blow Molding Machines come in two main types: Shuttle Machines and Rotary Wheel Machines. Shuttle Machines involve a horizontal movement of the mold while the parison is extruded vertically. This type is suitable for smaller production runs and product customizations. On the other hand, Rotary Wheel Machines have a vertical movement of the mold with the parison extruded horizontally. This type is ideal for higher volume production due to its faster cycle times and higher output capacity.</p></p>
