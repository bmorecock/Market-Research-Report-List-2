<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lateral Expansion Joints Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flange Type</li><li>Welding Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Lateral expansion joints are classified into two main types: flange type and welding type. Flange type expansion joints are connected using flanges and bolts, allowing for easy installation and maintenance. On the other hand, welding type expansion joints are welded directly to the piping system, providing a secure and leak-proof connection. Both types offer flexibility and movement to accommodate thermal expansion and contraction in piping systems, but the choice between them depends on factors such as piping material, operating conditions, and installation preferences.</p></p>
