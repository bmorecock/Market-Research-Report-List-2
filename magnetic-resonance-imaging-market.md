<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Magnetic Resonance Imaging Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed MRI Systems</li><li>Open MRI Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) systems are categorized into two main types: Closed MRI Systems and Open MRI Systems. Closed MRI Systems are traditional cylindrical scanners that enclose the patient, providing high-quality images but limiting space and potentially causing discomfort for claustrophobic patients. Open MRI Systems offer a more spacious and open design, catering to patients who may feel anxious or claustrophobic in closed systems. Both types serve different patient needs and preferences in the MRI market.</p></p>
