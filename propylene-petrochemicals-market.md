<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Propylene-Petrochemicals Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Homopolymer</li><li>Copolymer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Propylene is a key petrochemical used in the production of various polymer types, including homopolymers and copolymers. Homopolymers are made up of repeated units of only propylene molecules, resulting in a polymer with uniform properties. Copolymers, on the other hand, are produced by combining propylene with other monomers, leading to polymers with modified characteristics such as improved flexibility or impact resistance. Both homopolymers and copolymers play vital roles in industries like packaging, automotive, and construction.</p></p>
