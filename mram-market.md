<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The MRAM Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Toggle MRAM</li><li>STT-MRAM</li></ul></p>
<p><p>MRAM, or Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory, has two main types in the market: Toggle MRAM and STT-MRAM. Toggle MRAM uses a magnetic field to switch the orientation of its memory cells, resulting in fast read and write speeds. On the other hand, STT-MRAM, or Spin-Transfer Torque MRAM, utilizes an electric current to manipulate the spin of electrons, offering lower power consumption and potentially higher density. Both types of MRAM offer non-volatile memory capabilities, making them ideal for various applications in the electronics industry.</p></p>
