<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Open Magnetic Resonance Imaging System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Permanent Magnet</li><li>Superconducting</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Permanent Magnet MRI systems use a fixed magnet to generate a magnetic field for imaging. These systems are less expensive and easier to maintain than superconducting MRI systems. However, they have lower imaging quality and are less versatile in terms of imaging capabilities. On the other hand, superconducting MRI systems use superconducting coils cooled by liquid helium to generate a strong and uniform magnetic field, resulting in higher image resolution and better quality. These systems are more expensive but offer superior imaging capabilities.</p></p>
