<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spatial Filters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Resonant Type</li><li>Non-resonant Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Spatial filters can be categorized into two main types: resonant and non-resonant. Resonant spatial filters are designed to alter the frequency response of a system by exploiting resonances in the filter structure. They are typically more sensitive to frequency changes and are commonly used in applications where precise frequency adjustment is needed. On the other hand, non-resonant spatial filters work by attenuating certain frequencies without relying on resonances. They are more versatile and can be used in a wider range of applications.</p></p>
