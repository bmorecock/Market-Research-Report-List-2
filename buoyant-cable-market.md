<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Buoyant Cable Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Singlemode</li><li>Multimode</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Buoyant cable market consists of two major types: Singlemode and Multimode. Singlemode buoyant cables are designed to transmit signals over long distances with higher bandwidth and low attenuation, making them suitable for applications requiring high data transfer rates. On the other hand, Multimode buoyant cables are ideal for short distance transmissions due to their larger core size, allowing multiple modes of light to travel through the cable. Both types serve specific purposes in different underwater applications, offering unique benefits based on the requirements of the project.</p></p>
