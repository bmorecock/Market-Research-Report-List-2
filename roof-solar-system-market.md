<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Roof Solar System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fixed Solar System</li><li>Adjustable Solar System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In the roof solar system market, there are two main types: fixed solar systems and adjustable solar systems. Fixed solar systems are stationary and cannot be moved once installed on the roof, while adjustable solar systems can be tilted or moved to optimize the angle of the panels based on sunlight exposure. Fixed systems are more cost-effective and easier to install, while adjustable systems provide greater energy generation efficiency but come with a higher price tag and more complex installation process.</p></p>
