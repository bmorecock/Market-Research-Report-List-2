<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ultra Low-loss Optical Fiber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Multimode Fiber</li><li>Single-mode Fiber</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ultra low-loss optical fiber market consists of two main types: multimode fiber and single-mode fiber. Multimode fiber is designed for short-distance data transmission within buildings or campuses, offering a larger core size to allow multiple modes of light to propagate. Single-mode fiber, on the other hand, is optimized for long-distance communication, featuring a smaller core size that enables only one mode of light to travel, resulting in lower signal attenuation. Both types play critical roles in enabling high-speed and reliable optical communication networks.</p></p>
