<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Calciner Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Directly Heated Calciners</li><li>Indirectly Heated Calciners</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Directly heated calciners are a type of calciner where the material being processed comes into direct contact with the heat source. This allows for efficient heating and processing of the material. On the other hand, indirectly heated calciners are designed in a way that the material being processed does not come into direct contact with the heat source. This method is often used for materials that are sensitive to direct heat or require a more controlled heating process. Both types of calciners have their own advantages and are used in various industries for different applications.</p></p>
