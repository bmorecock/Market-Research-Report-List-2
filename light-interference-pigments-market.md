<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Light Interference Pigments Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Chemical Pocess</li><li>High Vacuum Process</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Light interference pigments are synthetic pigments that create color effects through interference of light waves. These pigments are made using two main processes, wet chemical process and high vacuum process. The wet chemical process involves mixing metal oxide substrates with various chemical agents to create the desired color effect. In contrast, the high vacuum process involves evaporating metal substrates in a vacuum chamber to create a thin film that produces the color effect. Both processes are used to create a variety of color-shifting pigments for applications in cosmetics, automotive coatings, and other industries.</p></p>
