<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Metal Coatings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid Coating</li><li>Powder Coating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Metal coatings can be categorized into two main types: liquid coating and powder coating. Liquid coatings involve applying a liquid mixture onto the metal surface, which then cures to form a protective layer. This method is commonly used for large surface areas and provides a smooth finish. On the other hand, powder coatings involve applying a dry powder to the metal surface, which is then heated and cured to create a durable and uniform finish. Powder coatings are known for their resistance to corrosion and abrasion.</p></p>
