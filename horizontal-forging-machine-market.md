<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Horizontal Forging Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hot Forging</li><li>Cold Forging</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Horizontal forging machines are commonly used in both hot forging and cold forging processes. In hot forging, the material is heated to a high temperature before being forged, allowing for greater malleability and easier shaping. Cold forging, on the other hand, involves shaping the material at room temperature without heating it, resulting in increased strength and precision. Both hot and cold forging markets utilize horizontal forging machines to efficiently produce a wide range of forged components for various industries.</p></p>
