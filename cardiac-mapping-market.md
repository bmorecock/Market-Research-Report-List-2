<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardiac Mapping Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Cardiac mapping systems</li><li>Non-contact Cardiac mapping systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cardiac mapping systems are used to diagnose and treat heart rhythm disorders. Contact cardiac mapping systems involve direct contact between the mapping catheter and the heart tissue, providing precise electrical signals. Non-contact cardiac mapping systems use advanced imaging technology to create a map of the heart's electrical activity without physically touching the heart. Both types offer valuable insights into the heart's electrical patterns and help guide healthcare professionals in determining the best treatment options for patients with heart rhythm disorders.</p></p>
