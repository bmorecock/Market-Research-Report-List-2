<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Digital Metal Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Very Low Frequency</li><li>Pulse Induction</li><li>Beat-frequency Oscillation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Digital Metal Detector market includes three main types: Very Low Frequency (VLF), Pulse Induction, and Beat-frequency Oscillation. VLF detectors are the most common, using two coils to transmit and receive signals, ideal for detecting coins, jewelry, and relics. Pulse Induction detectors are better for finding deep targets, as they send quick pulses of electricity into the ground. Beat-frequency Oscillation detectors use two coils at different frequencies to cancel out ground mineralization, making them suitable for saltwater beaches.</p></p>
